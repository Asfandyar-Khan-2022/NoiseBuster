NoiseBuster is an advanced Python application designed to monitor and log noise levels using a USB-connected sound meter. It not only records noise events but also integrates with various services like InfluxDB, MQTT, Discord, and more to provide a comprehensive noise monitoring solution. With features like weather data integration and traffic data collection, NoiseBuster offers a versatile tool for environmental monitoring and analysis.

## Usages

- Monitor loud traffic, planes, live events, and more.
- Create insightful graphics to share statistics with authorities.
- Analyze environmental noise in correlation with weather and traffic data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using NoiseBuster, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Operating System:** Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Raspberry Pi OS).
- **Python:** Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- **Sound Meter:** A USB-connected sound level meter. All models with USB communication capabilities should work. Other types like RS485 models and ESP devices with calibrated microphones could be used but may require additional setup by the user.
- **Internet Connection:** Required for API integrations (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Telraam).
- **Optional but Recommended:**
  - **InfluxDB 2.x and Grafana:** For data storage and visualization. **If you want to use these, you need to install them on your own** 
- **Optional:**
  - **MQTT Broker:** If you wish to publish data to an MQTT broker.
  - **Docker:** Installed for containerized deployment.

### Hardware Recommendations

- **PoE Splitter:** If you want to power your device using PoE, consider using a [PoE Splitter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006375194025.html).
- **IP65 Box:** For outdoor usage of your volume meter, I recommend using an [IP65 box](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005848967422.html) to protect the device.
- **Volume Meter:** I use this [USB volume meter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006419144001.html), which runs smoothly on a Raspberry Pi and is powered directly through USB.
- **Linux-Compatible Board:** Use a Raspberry Pi or any other board capable of running Linux.
- **Virtual Machines and Containers:** You can also run NoiseBuster in a VM, LXC, or other virtual environment, and simply pass through the USB volume meter, avoiding dedicated hardware.

### Hardware Requirements

- **USB Sound Meter:**
  - The application is designed to work with USB-connected sound level meters.
  - **Example Device:** [USB Sound Level Meter on AliExpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006973608966.html)
  - Ensure the device supports USB communication.
  - For devices not automatically detected, you may need to specify the USB vendor ID and product ID in the configuration. Use the `lsusb` command to find these IDs.

- **Camera (_Optional_):**
  - **IP Camera:** Supports RTSP or HTTP protocols. Provide the camera's URL in the configuration.
  - **Raspberry Pi Camera:** Connects directly to the Raspberry Pi. Requires the `picamera` library.

## Configuration

All configuration settings are stored in the `config.json` file. Here is how to set up your configuration:

      - Set `"enabled": true` to store data in InfluxDB.
      - Provide your InfluxDB `host`, `port`, `token`, `org`, and `bucket` names.
      - Ensure you create buckets named `"noise_buster"` and `"noise_buster_realtime"`.
      - **API Keys:** Follow the [InfluxDB setup guide](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/get-started/) to create your organization, buckets, and API tokens.

    - **Pushover Configuration (_Optional_):**
      - Set `"enabled": true` to receive Pushover notifications.
      - Provide your `user_key` and `api_token`. Register at [Pushover](https://pushover.net/).

    - **Weather Configuration (_Optional_):**
      - Set `"enabled": true` to fetch weather data.

      - Set `minimum_noise_level` in decibels to trigger events.
      - Specify `image_save_path` where images will be stored.
      - If automatic USB detection fails, provide `usb_vendor_id` and `usb_product_id`. Use the `lsusb` command to find these IDs.

    - **Telraam API Configuration (_Optional_):**
      - Set `"enabled": true` to collect traffic data.

I'm actively developing a vehicle detection and counting module based on YOLOv11 to correlate noise events with specific vehicle types. If you're interested in helping improve this model or contributing in other ways, please reach out! Any contributions to the detection and accuracy of vehicle classification would be invaluable.

## Next Steps

- Adding vehicle detection using OpenCV to correlate noise events with specific vehicles.
- Providing a centralized InfluxDB instance for users to contribute data.
- Investigating other hardware options like ESP devices for sound monitoring.
- Implementing better data retention policies to manage database size.
- A dedicated YOLO-powered traffic counting script is in development and will be available soon.
